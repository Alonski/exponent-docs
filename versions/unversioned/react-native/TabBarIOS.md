## itemPositioning

Specifies tab bar item positioning. Available values are:

-   fill - distributes items across the entire width of the tab bar
-   center - centers item in the available tab bar space
-   auto (default) - distributes items dynamically according to the
    user interface idiom. In a horizontally compact environment (e.g. iPhone 5)
    this value defaults to `fill`, in a horizontally regular one (e.g. iPad)
    it defaults to center.
