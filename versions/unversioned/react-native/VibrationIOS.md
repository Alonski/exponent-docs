## VibrationIOS

NOTE: `VibrationIOS` is being deprecated. Use `Vibration` instead.

The Vibration API is exposed at `VibrationIOS.vibrate()`. On iOS, calling this
function will trigger a one second vibration. The vibration is asynchronous
so this method will return immediately.

There will be no effect on devices that do not support Vibration, eg. the iOS
simulator.

Vibration patterns are currently unsupported.
